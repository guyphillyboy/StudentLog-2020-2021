Signing on, I would like to apologize for the tardiness of this log. I took some time on Monday to explore more of the logistics of the project. During this time I involuntarily completed the majority of milestone-1 and was reluctant to make a log as it was a process that I scattered throughout free time during the day.

Signing off, obviously did this throughout the day in intervals with many breaks; however, this was the time that officially closed all tabs and saved everything. I haven't pushed milestone-1 as I would like to address some aspects of it either tomorrow or in class Thursday.
